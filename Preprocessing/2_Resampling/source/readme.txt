In order for the scripts in this folder to work you need to retrieve the software package from https://www.treestoolbox.org/. 

This readme contains a short description of all the functions. The difference between the functions that treestoolbox overs and the one in this github is that these scripts can open and resample complete folders of .swc neuron files.

 - main.m:
 Takes three input arguments. The location of the folder where the swc files are stored, the routine that you wish to run and the resampling length.
 Based on the second input argument it can creates an equivalent BCT tree and performs basic resample preserving path length or just performs basic resampling.

 - imprint.m
 Is called by main.m. This goes through the folder and puts the names of all the swc file in one file.

 - insert.m
 Reads the file with the names of the .swc files generated by imprint and imports them as trees in the toolbox environment. This generates a multidimensional cell. 

 - resample_trees.
 Goes through the cell array and for each tree in the cell it resamples the tree (based on the routine specified) and generates the simplified tree structure. (similar to resample_tree from the treestoolbox but then works for an array of cells.)

 - sort_trees.m
Sort trees is specified creates an equivalent tree BCT structure. For information on what a BCT equivalent tree is I'd like to refer you to the https://www.treestoolbox.org/ for the manual. (similar to sort_tree from the treestoolbox but then works for an array of cells.)

- desert.m
 export the imported trees to a new swc file which we can import into neuroconstruct to change it to the neuroML format.

 - elecs.m
 Can be used to generate a heat map and look at the electrotonic signature of the tree. This function is used to see if the resampled tree has a similar electrotonic signature as the original. (I recommend using the gui from the treestoolbox (cgui_tree) rather than this function.)
